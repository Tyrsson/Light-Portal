# Export and import
Plugins can be exported as compressed archives, for easy transfer between forums or backup.

## Export plugins
In this section, you can export all or only selected plugins to a zip.gz file.

## Import plugins
In this section, you can import previously saved plugins from a zip file. You can also download in the same way "downloadable" plugins distributed as archives.

:::note

Before importing previously exported plugins, remember to extract the `zip` archive from the `zip.gz` archive
