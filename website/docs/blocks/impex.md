# Export and import
Portal blocks can be saved in a special file, for transferring to another forum, or for restoring after a clean installation of the forum.

## Export blocks
In this section, you can export all or only selected blocks to an XML file.

You can also export the desired blocks as a preset. In fact, it will create exactly the same `.xml` file as in the regular export, but with one exception - there will be no block identifiers in it. Thus, when importing such a file, the blocks will not be overwritten over the existing ones, but created anew.

## Import blocks
In this section, you can import previously saved blocks from an XML file.
